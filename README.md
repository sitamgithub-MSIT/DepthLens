# DepthLens

Depth Estimation is the task of predicting the depth of each pixel in an image. This project uses one of the popular models, [dpt-beit-large-512](https://huggingface.co/Intel/dpt-beit-large-512) for depth estimation from the Hugging Face model hub. The used model can be run in CPUs.

## Tech Stack

- Python (for the programming language)
- Hugging Face Transformers Library (for the visual question answering model)
- Gradio (for the web application)
- Hugging Face Spaces (for hosting the gradio application)

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/sitamgithub-MSIT/DepthLens.git`
2. Create a virtual environment: `python -m venv tutorial-env`
3. Activate the virtual environment: `tutorial-env\Scripts\activate`
4. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Run the Gradio application: `python app.py`

Now, open up your local host and you should see the web application running. For more information, refer to the Gradio documentation [here](https://www.gradio.app/docs/interface). Also, a live version of the application can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/sitammeur/DepthLens).

## Usage

The web application allows you to input an image, and the model will generate a depth map of the image. This can be useful in various applications such as autonomous driving, 3D modeling, augmented reality, and more. The depth estimation model provides a detailed understanding of the spatial structure of the scene in the image, enhancing the capabilities of computer vision systems.
